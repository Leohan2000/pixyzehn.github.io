I'm Hiroki Nagasawa and I live in Tokyo, Japan. Thank you for visiting this site. I mostly develop iOS apps and libraries. I'll write about tips that I wanted to share once in a while.
If you have a question and a feedback, feel free to contact me. The origin of my account name is pixy (so-called Dragan StojkoviÄ‡).

I like taking photos with iPhone everywhere and use flickr as a image hosting. Here are [my photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pixyzehn).

### About This Site

I build this site by [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). So far It looks good for me. I write articles in Markdown and deploy this site using [Github](https://github.com/pixyzehn/pixyzehn.github.io).
