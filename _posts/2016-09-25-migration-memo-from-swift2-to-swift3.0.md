I did migration from Swift2 to Swift3.0 in my app called [Esafeed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/esafeed-for-esa.io/id1111901482?mt=8). I'll take a note for future myself and may be others. I hope it'll be useful for you.

In my opinion, if your app is small compared to other apps, it may be better to skip `Swift2.3`. In short, use `Swift3.0`.
At first, I'm afraid of skipping `Swift2.3`, but it's easier more than I thought. Give it a try!

---

#### 1. Create a `feature/swift3.0` or `swift3.0` branch as you like

For me, to create a branch make me inevitable. It's like a putting pressure on myself.

#### 2. Use automatic converting

Be careful of choosing buttons. convert button's position is different. That's it.

#### 3. Set `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` (Option)

I set `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` disable in order not to show many redundant logs in Xcode console.

#### 3. Update libraries in response to Swift3.0

Check each library, and then choose `swift3.0` branch, `master` including Swift3.0 or `swift3`.
You may find an obsolete library, so it may be time to abandon an old library.

My `Cartfile` is like this for now (I only use Carthage in this app)  

```
github "ishkawa/APIKit" ~> 3.0
github "Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper" ~> 2.0.0
github "SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver"
github "ReactiveX/RxSwift" "3.0.0-beta.1"
github "delba/TextAttributes"
github "sberrevoets/SDCAlertView" ~> 7.0
github "venmo/Markingbird" ~> 1.13
github "onevcat/Kingfisher"
github "duemunk/Async" "feature/Swift_3.0"
github "kishikawakatsumi/KeychainAccess"
github "radex/SwiftyUserDefaults"
github "realm/realm-cocoa"
github "ArtSabintsev/Siren"
github "delba/SwiftyOAuth"
```

#### 4. Check entitlements

For instance, Keychain needs `entitlements`. Check apple official reference in details.  
[About Entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/EntitlementKeyReference/Chapters/AboutEntitlements.html)

#### 5. Change libraries if needed (Option)

As I said, I changed some libraries for migration.  
ex) In OAuth authentication, I used to use `OAuthSwift`, but I replaced `OAuthSwift` with `SwiftyOAuth`.

#### 6. Fix red errors

This part is tough for me at first, because it needs many manual and boring works. In a different perspective, I learned a lot of new features.  
You can confirm build success in here.

#### 7. Fix warnings as possible (Option)

I don't like remaining any warnings. Some warnings said that this will be deprecated in the future.  
Build success without any warnings.

#### 8. Check diff mainly generated by Xcode

I don't believe any generated codes. I did very careful review based on Github PR step by step. In my project, 1,977 lines (+1,044 -933) changed. Sometimes I found some strange convert. Xcode has done a great job :+1:

#### 9. Refer to API Design Guidelines

I think this is a really important point. This is my real examples.

```swift
// Swift2
func requestWithPage(page: Int) -> MembersRequest {

// Swift3.0
func request(withPage page: Int) -> MembersRequest {

// Swift2
func responseFromObject(object: AnyObject, URLResponse: NSHTTPURLResponse) -> Response? {

// Swift3.0
func response(from object: Any, urlResponse: HTTPURLResponse) throws -> Status {

// Swift2
UINavigationBar.appearance().tintColor = .whiteColor()

// Swift3.0
UINavigationBar.appearance().tintColor = UIColor.white

// Swift2
enum Section: Int, Enumerable {
  case Profile = 0
  ...
}

// Swift3.0
enum Section: Int, Enumerable {
  case profile = 0
  ...
}
```

I kept in mind to select good first labels.

#### 10. Fix CI and release process(like a Fastlane)

Skip the details because there are a ton of options.

#### 11. Merge Swift3.0 branch

This is a short and brief memo. If you don't yet, I recommend updating right now. Enjoy with Swift3.0:)

I'm still not used to writing codes like Swift3.0. @inaka said

> A piece of advice: Read the Swift 3 API design guidelines once and again. Every day in the morning, if necessary, until you get used to the new way of writing Swift code.

That makes sense.
