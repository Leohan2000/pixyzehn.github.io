This is an incomplete list of books (including books written in Japanese) I have read. Irrespective of genre, I'm going to write it down with a kind of rating🌟 and my quick review📝. I inspired by [this book list](http://radex.io/books/){:target="_blank"}. I have a pile of books I haven't read yet. This page is a one of solutions for that. My goal is to read more than 15 books per year.
